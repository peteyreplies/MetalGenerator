#Metal Generator 

A Twitter bot (to be built) which pseudorandomly generates metal genre ideas (and maybe other things eventually) based roughly on the following syntax: 

"I just heard this new band, they're like X Y Z metal/core"


i.e., 

"like satanic dwarven doom metal"
"like sludgey melodic mathcore" 

and/or 

"It's like X crossed with Y, but Z"

i.e. 

"It's like The Carpenters crossed with Dimmu Borgir, but heavier" 
"It's like Buddy Holly crossed with Metallica, but mathier"

Probably need lists, including: 

* actual metal genres (tech, math, heavy, progressive, black, folk, etc)
* nerd shit (dwarven, elven, wizard, numenorean, space, dragon, etc)
* nationalities (norwegian, australian, malagesy, irish)
* metal bands (scrape from wiki?)
* definitely NOT metal bands (ibid)
* superlatives (heavier, faster, sludgier, darker)
* music nerd stuff (ionic, doric, locrian, sycopantic, etc)

None of this is built yet, just a placeholder for when I have time.
